The VoiceMan readme

VoiceMan is a lightweight speech processing daemon for GNU/Linux
(maybe for other UNIXes as well, but this didn't tested). Lightweight
there means that VoiceMan generally doesn't take care about any audio
signal processing, it just takes commands to speak and launches
corresponding speech synthesizers as external programs, giving them
data on stdin. Meantime, VoiceMan has some features for text
processing.

At the current moment, VoiceMan is a part of the LUWRAIN project
(http://luwrain.org), because it is used as a main speech processing
platform in LUWRAIN bootable images. VoiceMan has the emacspeak
client, so it can be used for processing output from emacspeak and
yasr. Unfortunately, VoiceMan doesn't suit for using with Orca as Orca
doesn't have support of emacspeak protocol any more.

I'm thinking about writing VoiceMan 2.0 with D-Bus support but due to
lack of spare time it's very difficult to say when it could be
released.
